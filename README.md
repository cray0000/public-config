## [karabiner.json](/karabiner.json)

My Karabiner-Elements config for EU-type Mac keyboard with the following features:

1. diamond cursor (Alt+jkli to arrows).
2. extended diamond cursor configuration for easy Enter, Delete, Backspace, Esc, PgUp, PgDown, Home, End.
3. emulation of US-type keyboard on the built-in EU-type Macbook keyboard.

### Installation:

1. Put `karabiner.json` to `~/.config/karabiner/karabiner.json`. Overwrite the existing one.
2. Open Karabiner-Elements preferenses, go to `Profiles`, select the `Universal` profile. It supports both the built-in EU apple keyboard and the external USB keyboards. If you have a US-type keyboard MacBook, select the `Keyboard` profile.
